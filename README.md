This code has been modified by me and mainly serve my purpose. At the beggining it was a fork from https://github.com/kdtheory/credit-agricole-importer.git, the intend of this repo was to have the code in docker. I modify everythings and is now capable of many things.

# Credit Agricole Importer for FireflyIII

Automatic import of [Credit Agricole](https://www.credit-agricole.fr/) accounts and transactions into [FireflyIII](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii) personal finance manager, 
made with use of [python-creditagricole-particuliers](https://github.com/dmachard/python-creditagricole-particuliers) and [Firefly-III-API-Client](https://github.com/ms32035/firefly-iii-client).
This project allows for the automatic import of banking transactions from a Cr√©dit Agricole account into Firefly III, a personal financial management application. The project uses a **`.env`** file for configuring credentials and parameters, which are then processed by a **`generate_config.sh`** script to generate the necessary configuration files for the project.

## Features
- **Automatic transaction import**: Synchronizes banking transactions from the Cr√©dit Agricole API to Firefly III.
- **Duplicate detection**: Checks before each import to avoid adding transactions that already exist in Firefly III.
- **Multi-account management**: Supports multiple Cr√©dit Agricole accounts and maps them to specific accounts in Firefly III.
- **Automatic scheduling**: Executes daily at 8 AM via cron (configurable) to keep your data up to date.
- **Log anonymization**: Sensitive information such as amounts and descriptions are masked in logs to protect confidentiality.

<b>*</b>_Although these functionalities are available in the FireflyIII dashboard with [automated rules](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/firefly-iii/features/rules/), they have been integrated into credit-agricole-importer. This integration allows for the execution of these actions directly through the application, bypassing the need for the [FireflyIII](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii) instance.

## Prerequisites

- A Cr√©dit Agricole account with access to the Cr√©dit Agricole Particuliers API.
- A [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org/) instance configured with a personal access token.
- Docker (optional but recommended for simplified execution).

## FAQ

### How can I get my FireflyIII `personal-token` ?

Use [Personal Access Token](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/how-to/firefly-iii/features/api/#personal-access-token_1) in your FireflyIII instance Profile menu.

### Are my Credit Agricole credentials safe ?

When it comes to storing your credentials in the ```config.ini``` file, it's crucial to ensure that this file is not accessible from public addresses. You should make every effort to secure your host machine as effectively as possible. **However, please note that I cannot be held responsible if someone manages to steal your credentials.** 

If any system security experts happen to come across this, please don't hesitate to initiate a discussion with me on how we can enhance our storage methods. Your insights and expertise would be greatly appreciated.

### Can anybody contribute ?

Certainly! If you have any improvement ideas or wish to implement new features yourself, please don't hesitate to do so. I'm open to pull requests, but I do take a thorough and meticulous approach when reviewing them before merging. **Your contributions are highly appreciated!** üòÉ
